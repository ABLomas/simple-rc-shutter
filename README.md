# simple-rc-shutter
Very basic photo shutter for SONY cameras.

Had no suitable opamp around, so did simple PWM from old Arduino ProMini board.
Sides can be cut down to shrink board size, schematics in /img/ folder.

3 or 2 position switch (middle = focus), delays may require some customizing with slow lens/camera.

Multiport cable can be purchased in CN (won't work with typical 5-pin USB cable) for something like 3â‚¬, for example: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001231240583.html
